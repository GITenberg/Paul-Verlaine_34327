<h2 style="margin-top: 2em; page-break-before: auto;">PRELUDE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> works of great artists are silent
books of eternal truths. And thus it is
indelibly written in the face of Balzac,
as Rodin has graven it, that the beauty
of the creative gesture is wild, unwilling
and painful. He has shown that
great creative gifts do not mean fulness
and giving out of abundance. On the
contrary the expression is that of one
who seeks help and strives to emancipate
himself. A child when afraid
thrusts out his arms, and those that are
falling hold out the hand to passers-by
for aid; similarly, creative artists project
their sorrows and joys and all their
sudden pain which is greater than their
own strength. They hold them out like
a net with which to ensnare, like a rope
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>by which to escape. Like beggars on
the street weighed down with misery
and want, they give their words to passers-by.
Each syllable gives relief because
they thus project their own life
into that of strangers. Their fortune
and misfortune, their rejoicing and
complaint, too heavy for them, are
sown in the destiny of others&mdash;man
and woman. The fertilizing germ is
planted at this moment which is simultaneously
painful and happy, and they
rejoice. But the origin of this impulse,
as of all others, lies in need, sweet, tormenting
need, over-ripe painful force.</p>

<p>No poet of recent years has possessed
this need of expressing his life to others,
more imperatively, pitifully, or tragically
than Paul Verlaine, because no
other poet was so weak to the press of
destiny. All his creative virtue is reversed
strength; it is weakness. Since
he could not subdue, the plaint alone
remained to him; since he could not
mould circumstances, they glimmer in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>naked, untamed, humanly-divine
beauty through his work. Thus he has
achieved a primæval lyricism&mdash;pure
humanity, simple complaint, humbleness,
infantile lisping, wrath and reproach;
primitive sounds in sublime
form, like the sobbing wail of a beaten
child, the uneasy cry of those who are
lost, the plaintive call of the solitary
bird which is thrown out into the dusk
of evening.</p>

<p>Other poets have had a wider range.
There have been the criers who with a
clarion horn call together the wanderers
on all the highways, the magicians
who weave notes like the rustling of
leaves, the soughing of winds and the
bubbling of water, and the masters who
embrace all the wisdom of life in dark
sayings. He possessed nothing but the
sign-manual of the weak who have need
of another, the gestures of a beggar.
But in all their accents and nuances, in
him, these became wonderful. In him
were the low grumbling of the weak
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>man, sometimes closely akin to the sorrowful
mumbling of the drunkard, the
tender flute notes of vague and melancholic
yearning, as well as the hard accusing
hammering against his own
heart. There were in him the flagellant
strokes of the penitent as well as the intimate
prayers of thanksgiving which
poor women murmur on church steps.
Other poets have been so interwoven
with the universal that it is impossible
to distinguish whether really great
storms trembled in their breasts,
whether the sea rolled within them, or
again, whether it was not their words,
which made the meadows shudder, and
which, as a breeze, went tenderly over
the fields. They were the vivifying
poets, the synthesizers&mdash;divinities by
the marvel of creation, and its priests.</p>

<p>Verlaine was always only a human
being, a weak human being, who did not
even know how &ldquo;to count the transgressions
of his own heart.&rdquo; It was
this very lack of individuality, however,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>which produced something much rarer&mdash;the
purely and entirely human. Verlaine
was soft clay without the power
of producing impresses and without resistance.
Thus every line of life crossing
his destiny has left a pure relief, a
clear and faithful reproduction, even to
the fragrance-like sorrows of lonely
seconds which in others fade away or
thicken into dull grief. The tangled
forces which tempestuously shook his
life and tore it to tatters crystallized in
his work and were distilled into essences.</p>

<p>This, together with the fact that he
has enriched and furthered literary development
by his poetry, is the highest
and noblest meed of praise that can be
given to a poet. Yet such an estimate
seems too low to many of his followers,
especially the more recent French literati
who celebrate in Verlaine the unconscious
inventor of a new art of poetry
and the initiator of new lyric epochs,
unknowing of the folly of their proceeding.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>Verlaine, the literary man,
was a sad caricature distorted by ribald
noise and Quartier-Latin cafés. Even
as such he indignantly denied this intention.
The greatness and power of
his lyricism takes its root in eternity,
in the wonderful sincerity of its ever
human and unalterable emotional content,
and above all in the unconsciousness
of its genesis.</p>

<p>Intellectuals alone create &ldquo;tendencies.&rdquo;
Verlaine was as little one of
these as he was on the other hand the
<i>bon enfant</i>, the innocently stumbling
child into whose open and playful hand
verses fell like cherry blossoms or fluttering
leaves. He was a lyric poet.
Lyricism is thinking without logic (although
not contrary to logic), association
not according to the laws of
thought but according to intuition, the
whispering words of vague emotions,
hidden correspondences, darkly murmuring
subterranean streams. Lyricism
again is thought without consequence,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>instinct and presentiment, leaping
quickly in lawless synthesis; it is
union but not a chain formed of individual
links, it is melody but not scales.
In this sense he was an unconscious
creator who heard great accords.</p>

<p>He was never a thinker. His quick
power of observation, flashing electrically,
his Gallic wit, and his exquisite
feeling for style were able to illumine
splendidly, narrow circles, but he
lacked, as in everything, the power and
ability of logical sequence. He knew
how to seize and throw light upon
waves that came to touch his life, but he
could not make them reflect in the
dark mirror of the universe, nor could
he throw out into the world rays of
curious and tormenting desire for life.
He could not construct a world vision,
revolution, and a sense of distance.
This wild and heroic trait of the great
poets was never his. He preferred,
fleeting and weak spirit as he was, the
indefinite, not quiet and possession, nor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>understanding and power, which are
the elemental factors of life. He surrendered
himself completely to the efflorescence
of things, to the sweetness
of becoming and the sadness of evanescence,
to the pain and tenderness of
emotions that touch us in passing; in
short, to the things that come to us and
not to those which we must seek and
strive to penetrate. He was never a
drawn bow ready to fling himself as an
arrow into the infinite; he was only an
æolian harp, the play and voice of such
winds as came. Unresistingly he threw
himself into the arms of all dangers&mdash;women,
religiosity, drunkenness and
literature. All this oppressed him and
rent him asunder. The drops of blood
are magnificent poems, imperishable
events, primæval human emotion clear
as crystal.</p>

<p>Two factors were responsible for
this: an unexampled candor in both
virtue and vice, and his complete unconsciousness,
which, however, was unfortunately
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>lost in the first waves of his
fame. As he never knew how to weed,
his life forced strange blossoms and
became a wonderful garden of seductively
beautiful, perversely colored
flowers, among which he himself was
never entirely at home. In middle life
he found the courage, or rather an impulse
within him mightier than his will
forced him to do so, and with relentless
tread he left civilization. He exchanged
the warm cover of an established
literary reputation for the occasional
shelter along the highways.
With the smoke of his pipe he blew into
the air the esteem he had acquired
early. He never returned to the safe
harbor. Later, as &ldquo;man of letters,&rdquo; he
unfortunately exaggerated this as well
as every other of his unique characteristics,
in an idle exhibitionism, and
made literary use of them.</p>

<p>Far distant from academies and
journals, he retained his uniqueness uninterruptedly
for many years. He has
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>described in his verses the errant and
passionate way of his life with that
noble absence of shame which is the
first sign of personal emancipation
from civilized humanity, in contrast to
the primitively natural.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written as to
whether happiness or unhappiness was
the result of the pilgrimage. It is an
unimportant and idle question, because
&ldquo;happiness&rdquo; is only a word, an unfilled
cup in strange hands, and an
empty tinkling thing. At any rate, life
cut more deeply into his flesh than into
that of any other poet of our time. So
tightly and pitilessly was his soul
wound about that nothing was kept
silent, and it bled to death with sighs,
rejoicings, and cries. A destiny which
has accomplished such marvels may be
rebuked as cruel. But we in whom
these pains re-echo in sweet shudderings&mdash;for
us, it is fitting that we
should feel gratitude.</p>

<h2>CONCERNING &ldquo;POOR LELIAN&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> Verlaine speaks of his
childhood, there is a gleam like a bittersweet
smile. This hesitant, plaintive
rhythm appears ever, and ever again,
whether in sorrow, musing sigh, or
plaintive reproach. It appears in the
tender and so infinitely sad lines which
he wrote in prison, and likewise in the
<i>Confessions</i>, a vain, exaggeratedly candid
and coquetting portrait in prose.
Gentle memories, fresh and tender like
white roses, creep loosely through all
his work, scattering pious <ins title="fragrance">fragrance.</ins>
For him childhood was paradise, because
his poor weak soul, needing the
tenderness of faithful hands, had not
yet experienced the hard impacts of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>life, but only the soft intimate cradling
between devoted love and womanly
mildness&mdash;a lulling, sweet unforgettable
melody.</p>

<p>All impulses are still pure and bud-like.
Love is unsullied, sheer instinct,
entirely without desire and restlessness.
It is silence, peaceful silence, cool longing
which assuages, and so all of life
is kind and large, maternal and womanly&mdash;soft.
Everything shines in a
clear, transparent, shimmering light
like a landscape at daybreak. Even
late, very late, when his poor life had
already become barren and over-clouded,
this yearning still rises and
trembles toward these days of youth
like a white dove. The &ldquo;<i>guote suendaere</i>&rdquo;
still had tears to give. Gleaming
pure like dew drops, and still fresh,
they cling to the most fantastic and
wildest blooms.</p>

<p>The first dates tell little. Paul
Marie Verlaine was born in 1844 at
Metz&mdash;he did not remember his second
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>name until the appropriate time of
his conversion. His father was a captain
in the French engineer corps.
Verlaine, however, was not of Alsatian
extraction but belonged to Lorraine,
close enough to Germany to bear in his
blood the secret fructification of the
German <i>Lied</i>. Early in his life the
family removed to Paris, where the attractive
boy with inquisitive, soft face
(as is shown on an early photograph)
soon turns into a <i>gosse</i> and finally into
a government official with skillful literary
talents.</p>

<p>Several pleasing episodes and a few
kind figures are found within this simple
frame of his external life. Two in
particular are drawn in subdued delicate
colors and veiled with a tender
fragrance. Both were women. His
mother, all goodness and devotion,
spoiling him with too much tenderness
and forgiveness, passes through his life
with uniformly quiet tread; she is a
wonderfully noble martyr. There is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>hardly a more poignant story than the
one he tells regretfully in the <i>Confessions</i>
of the time when he first began to
drink and how his mother never voiced
her reproach. Once when with hat on
his head he had slept out the remainder
of a wild night, her only comment was
the silent one of holding a mirror before
him.</p>

<p>And there is no more tragic incident
among the many sentences of the
drunkard than the verdict of the tribunal
at Vouziers, which condemned him
to a fine of five hundred francs for
threatening to kill his mother. Even
then, though absinthe had changed the
simple child always ready for penance
into a different man, her gesture was
still the noble and inimitable one of
forgiveness.</p>

<p>There were also other tender hands
to watch over his youth. His cousin
Eliza, who died early, is a figure so mild
and transparent and of so light a tread
that she appears like one of Jacobsen's
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>wonderful creations who wander and
speak like disembodied souls. She had
the unique beauty of early illness, and
on that account perhaps turned more
toward the absorbed but not melancholy
child, excusing his escapades.
She was loved tenderly, with a child's
love that was without desire and danger.</p>

<div class="poem" style="max-width: 23em;">
<div class="stanza">
&ldquo;Certes oui pauvre maman était<br/>
Bien, trop bonne, et mon c&oelig;ur à la voir palpitait,<br/>
Tressautait, et riait et pleurait de l'entendre<br/>
Mais toi, je t'aimais autrement non pas plus tendre<br/>
Plus familier, <ins title="voila">voilà</ins>.&rdquo;
</div>
</div>

<p>It was she too who staged his last
youthful folly by giving him the money
for printing the <i>Poèmes Saturniens</i>.
Like a white flame her figure shines
through the dense stifling fumes of his
life. It is as if the soft tread of these
two women had given many of his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>verses their seraphic sheen and lent the
mother-of-pearl opalescence to his softest
poems, in which there is a secret
rustling as of the folds of women's
gowns. Even the Paul Verlaine of the
later years, &ldquo;the ruin insufficiently
ruined,&rdquo; who saw in woman the most
ferocious enemy, and who fled to the
wolves that they might protect him
from &ldquo;woman their sister,&rdquo; even he still
dreamed of the folded hands, of the forgiving
innocent gesture of the earliest
memories. This yearning for mild and
pure women has found many incarnations.
In the poems to his bride, Mathilde
Manté, it is the tender song of
the troubadour; in the hours of his
mystical conversion it becomes a tender
prayer and Madonna cult; in the years
of his decadence it appears as a pathetic
echo, a stumbling plaint and dreamy
childhood desires&mdash;the precious hour
between sin and sin. Sometimes this
secret desire is placed tenderly and
simply into lines of verse as into a rare,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>fragrant shrine where the dearest possessions
are kept. These are pure, wonderful
lines like the following, full of
longing and renunciation:</p>

<div class="poem" style="max-width: 20em;">
<div class="stanza">
&ldquo;Je voudrais, si ma vie était encore <ins title="a">à</ins> faire,<br/>
Qu'une femme très calme <ins title="habitat">habitât</ins> avec moi.&rdquo;
</div>
</div>

<p>Verlaine soon left these mirror-clear
days of beautiful youth. His father
decided to put him into a boarding-school
at Paris. The dreamy little
boy, looking toward the gay school cap,
gladly assented. This was the turning
point. Here his life in a way was rent
in two parts, and a wide gap appears in
the weakly but not morbid character of
the child. The somewhat spoiled, modest,
and confiding boy is put among
students who are already dissolute and
overbearing. On the very first day he
is sickened by the coldness and barrenness
of the rooms, and frightened by the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>first contact with life he is instinctively
afraid of the evil which was to overtake
him after all. Filled with that mighty
longing for tenderness and gentle shelter
which even at fifty he did not lose,
he fled to his home in tears. He was
greeted there with cries of joy and embraces,
but on the next morning he was
taken back with gentle force.</p>

<p>This was the catastrophe. Verlaine's
weak character willingly submitted to
foreign influences; it became dulled
under the influence of his comrades,
&ldquo;and the overthrow began.&rdquo; A foreign
element entered his being, a materialistic
cynical trait, for the present
only <i>gaminerie</i>, while he was still a
stranger to sex. The specific Parisian
character, a mingling of vanity, insolence,
scoffing wit (<i>raillerie</i>) and boastful
bravado, tempted the soft dreamy
boy, but conquered him only for short
hours.</p>

<p>This conflict between feminine sensitivity
and a <i>gaminerie</i> eager for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>enjoyment wages incessant warfare
throughout his life. Sometimes it harmonizes
for brief moments voluptuousness
and idealism, but neither side ever
wins and the struggle never ceases.
The characteristics of Faust and Mephistopheles
never became fully linked
in Verlaine; they only interlaced.
With the overpowering capacity for
self-surrender which he spent on everything,
he could combine the sensual
alone or the spiritual alone completely
with his life, but lacking will, he was
unable to put an end to the constant
rotation, which now dragged him in
penitence from his passions only to hurl
him back again into their hated hands.
Thus his life consists not of an evenly
ascending plane, but of headlong descents
and catastrophes, of elevations
and transfigurations, which finally end
in a great weariness.</p>

<p>The sense of shame was exceptionally
strong in him, as it is in every case
where it is repressed. All his life long
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>it made itself heard in the form of
yearning for clarity and purity. Afraid
of mockery, cynicism and indifference
were put forward as a protection until
at length these evil influences overgrew
it entirely. Were it not unwise to reflect
in directions which his life disdained
to follow, it might be interesting
to attempt a portrait of Verlaine as he
might have been if he had continued on
the luminous path of his childhood under
the guidance of kind hands. For
surely and also according to his own
opinion, those years were the humus for
the <i>fleurs du mal</i> of his soul.</p>

<p>In these formative years of ungainly
figure and uncertain dreaming the poet
grows out of the boy. A malign influence,
puberty, forces the creator in him.
&ldquo;The man of letters, let us say rather,
if you prefer, the poet was born in me
precisely toward that so critical fourteenth
year, so that I can say proportionately
as my puberty developed my
character too was formed.&rdquo; This is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>surely a womanly and feminine trait,
for in women the entire spiritual development
usually trembles as the resonance
of the inner shock. Physical
crises are transformed into catastrophes
of the soul, and the pressure of the
blood and its beating waves are spiritualized
into the soft melancholy and
sweet dreams from which his verses rise
like tender buds.</p>

<p>It is not out of intellectual growth or
out of the persistent impulse to link the
universal to his personality, as in the
cases of Schiller, Victor Hugo or Lord
Byron, that these soft notes rise. They
have their origin in a sultry restlessness
of the nerves, in the well-springs of
fruitful impulse, in emotions and shadowy
presentiments. They are the early
outpouring of creative masculinity and
youthful yearning. They are half a
question and half an answer to life.
They are melancholy and vague, filled
with uncertain gleaming and a rustling
darkness.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
If poetry consists in a certain sensitiveness
of soul and reaction to slight
and cautious stimulation, and not in an
active, wild, subduing force, Verlaine
certainly has sensed the deepest fount
of the orphic mysteries. If poetry is so
understood, the boy who wrote the
<i>Poèmes Saturniens</i> on his school
benches, already saw the reality of life
and even the future mask. His acute
ear heard the oracle which foretold his
destiny, but he did not know how to interpret
what the Pythian voice had
whispered until everything was fulfilled.
To understand this, sensitiveness
must not be confused with sentimentality.
Sentimentality may grow
out of a pessimism which has been acquired
intellectually. Sensitivity is not
only the child of emotion but at the
same time the sum and substance of all
feelings. It is both an inherent tendency
and an innate possession, and is
primæval and indestructible as is the
gift of poetry itself. The gift of poetry
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>implies the power of distilling emotions
into that form in which they are
already essentially existing and fixing
the fleeting and ephemeral permanently
as by a chemical process which knows
no law but only presentiment and
chance.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no art without its
technique, understanding technique not
in the derogatory sense of a mere implement
but somewhat in the sense of the
material which the painter uses, who
must apply it individually and thus
adds something unknown and unique to
what he has acquired by education and
copying. Verlaine learned his technique
early, and he never wrote a line in
which his own guidance could be felt.
His earliest teachers were Baudelaire,
Banville, Victor Hugo, Catulle Mendès
and other Parnassiens, cool idealists or
frosty exotics, measured and stiff even
in their melancholy, but wise architects
of slender and firmly founded verse-structures,
artists in language, chisellers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>of form. The pliant, soft yielding
manner of Verlaine quickly embraced
their influences. The student is already
master of the <i>métier</i>. Even the relentless
and unhappy rhymester into which
&ldquo;poor Lelian&rdquo; turned, late, very late
in his career, retained this eminent skill
of reproducing forms smoothly and
precisely, and writing verses of an
agreeable, melodic flow and a beautiful
rhythmic movement.</p>

<p>The years of puberty were the time
of the production of the <i>Poèmes Saturniens</i>.
Sexuality had not yet developed
sufficiently and was not strong and self-willed
enough to operate destructively.
Its influence was only felt in slight impacts
and produced the feeling of sweet
unrest. This unrest, somewhat veiled
and turning toward melancholy, trembles
through these early poems and
lends them the unique beauty of sad
women. All the art of Verlaine's poetry
is already found in these first
poems.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
The book appeared, thanks to the assistance
of his cousin Eliza, under Lemerre's
imprint, curiously enough on
the same day as François Coppée's first
work, and had a &ldquo;<i>joli <ins title="succés">succès</ins> de hostilité</i>&rdquo;
with the press. The great writers&mdash;Victor
Hugo, Leconte de Lisle,
Theodore de Banville, and others&mdash;wrote
him encouraging letters, but the
public at large did not overburden the
young man with its admiration.</p>

<p>At that time Verlaine was a clerk in
the Hôtel de Ville and lived a quiet,
almost well-to-do life, with his mother.
All the indications were in favor of a
smooth, unclouded future. But there
was a conflict in him, which he could not
master. It is like raising and lowering
two weights which he never succeeds in
balancing. On the one hand is the passionate,
wild, sexual element, the impure
glow and the blind surrender, the
&ldquo;black ship which drags him to the
abyss,&rdquo; and, on the other, the pure,
simple, tender mode of his child-like
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>heart, which, a stranger to all passion,
yearns for soft, <ins title="womenly">womanly</ins> hands.</p>

<p>In normal sexuality the yearning of
the senses and the soul unite during the
seconds of intoxication and become the
symbol of infinity, through the passionate
absorption of contrasts and the permeation
of spirit with matter, and form
with substance, elements which in their
turn are the creative symbols of all life.
In Verlaine, however, there was always
a cleft: now he is pure pilgrim of
yearning, now roué; now priest, now
gamin. He has wrought the most
beautiful religious poems of Catholicism,
and at the same time has won the
crown of all pornographic works with
perverse and indecent poems. As the
flux of his blood went, so was he&mdash;a
<i>pure reflex of his organic functions</i>.
That is to say he was infinitely primitive
as a poet, and infinitely complicated
and unaccountable as a human
being.</p>

<p>Whenever his impulses were elastic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>and his senses sharpened or stimulated,
the untamed and wild beast of sensuality
is unchained in his life, turbulent
after satisfaction, incapable of restraint
by intellectual deliberation. After the
crisis physical exhaustion disengaged
the psychic elements of penitence, consideration
and tender longing, which
later became piety.</p>

<p>Verlaine was a poet of rare candor
and shamelessness, both in the best and
worst sense. This is the essentially
great element in his otherwise feminine,
weak and absolutely <i>negative</i> personality.
The primæval powers of the body
and soul are the eternal elements of all
humanity and the starting-point of all
philosophies; the conflict between them,
betrayed in the accusing and self-revealing
manner of his verse, is <ins title="transferrel">transferred</ins>
unchanged into his poetry, filling
it with the force of life and the tragedy
of the universally human.</p>

<p>In his entire life there seem to have
been only two brief periods of cessation
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>in the struggle; during the short
honeymoon or period of normal sexuality
and during his first religious epoch,
when he was sincere, and enthusiasm
and yearning, transfused in the symbols
of faith and religious veneration, interpenetrated
and inflamed each other.</p>

<p>The <i>Fêtes Galantes</i> were published
soon after the <i>Poèmes Saturniens</i>. Artistically
they are far superior, because
their form is more individual, their
structure more original, and their architecture
more compact. Yet they do not
appear to me to represent balance, but
rather the short trembling, to-and-fro
wavering of the scales of his impetuous
and sensitive character.</p>

<p>They are coquettish; and coquetry
is sensuality with style, tamed accordingly,
but not conquered. They are at
the same time modest and impudent,
attack and careful retreat. They are
not pure sensuality, but desire, masked
by a demand for modesty.</p>

<p>It is the most characteristically
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>French of his books, drawn as with the
maliciously kind brush of Watteau. In
these poems, in which Verlaine's muse
trips on high-heeled shoes through gardens
which shimmer in the gleam of a
mocking moon, in these whispering dialogues
between Pierrots and Columbines,
in these gallant landscapes, an
anxious presentiment weeps plaintively
in the bushes. This sad mode makes
the dallying faces gleam underneath
tears. The true voice of the yearning
soul is poured out and dies away in the
imperishable <i>Colloque <ins title="Sentimentale">Sentimental</ins></i>, a
dark pearl of indefinite, infinite sorrow.
Out of masks and pantomimes, the
poet's face stares sadly bewildered into
the black mirror of reality.</p>

<p>At that time an evil influence had
broken into his life, perhaps the most
destructive, &ldquo;the one unpardonable
vice,&rdquo; as he himself confesses. Verlaine
began to drink. At first it was bravado,
recklessness, persuasion; later it was
desire, torture, flight from the qualms
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>of his conscience, &ldquo;the forgetfulness,
sought in execrable potions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drank absinthe, a sweetish, greenish
liquid, which is false as cat's eyes
and treacherous and murderous like a
diseased harlot. Baudelaire's hashish is
comprehensible. It was the magician
who raised fantastic landscapes, it
quieted the nerves, it was the poet of
the poet. Verlaine's absinthe is only
destructive and obliterating, a slow poison
which does not kill but unnerves
and undermines like the white powders
the dreaded secret of which the Borgias
held. Absinthe wrought silently and
inexorably in Verlaine's life. By degrees
it absorbed the tender, soft,
yearning, vague qualities of his heart
of a child; it made the hard, passionate,
depraved man strong, and awakened
the sensualist and cynic in him. Even
when the high-arched churches and the
figures of the Madonnas no longer offered
him a place of refuge, &ldquo;the atrocious
green sorceress&rdquo; was still his only
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>comforter, into whose arms he willingly
cast himself.</p>

<p>He himself tells regretfully how at
the time of his cousin Eliza's death, soon
after the appearance of his first book,
he joined sorrow and vice in tragic
manner. For two days he had not
touched food. But he drank, drank
without interruption, restlessly, and returned
to the offices a drunkard, drowning
the reproof of his superior in a new
absinthe. Everything that was hard,
bitter, wild, which later broke loose in
him so tempestuously, compelling the
law to step between him and his wife,
his mother and his friends, was called
forth by the green poison in the silent,
kindly nature which loved soft words
and was inclined even to his last years
to the power of hot tears. With pitiless
force this most dangerous of his
vices drew taut the chain, by which the
passions and sudden catastrophe of his
destiny dragged him on to the road of
misery.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
For a moment it seemed as if everything
were to come to a good end. He
fell in love with the explosive vehemence
and despairing persistence with
which the weak are accustomed to cling
to an idea. The step-sister of his
friend, de Sivry, had fascinated him.
As a matter of fact the engagement
came about. In these days, separated
from his bride, Verlaine wrote the slender
volume of songs, <i>La Bonne Chanson</i>.
It is his most quiet and balanced
book. According to his own repeatedly
expressed opinion, he considered it the
most beautiful of his works and the one
dearest to him. In the best and noblest
sense they are &ldquo;occasional verses.&rdquo;
Almost daily one is written and sent to
his beloved. It was only in small selection
that they were united in print.</p>

<p>Here the idea of modesty subdues
passion like a wonderful sordine, and
surrender and tenderness intertwine
with the ideals of modesty. The cleft
in Verlaine's personality closes in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>consonance of a soul which has found
peace. It represents the first period of
peace in his life and career and is
humanly his most perfect moment and
poetically his purest. Vice and passion
have disappeared in a hesitating yet desirous
surrender, melancholy has dissolved
in melody.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo, the sovereign coiner of
great phrases, called the <i>Bonne Chanson</i>,
&ldquo;<i>une fleur dans un obus</i>.&rdquo; There
are poems in this slim volume which
seem as if they had been woven out of
the gushing flood of moonlight. There
are poems which gleam like pale pearls
and lonely pools. Word and sense,
form and emotion, foreboding and being,
life and dreams, are their woof.
Here appeared that marvel of French
lyric poetry, the wonderful poem.</p>

<p>From this point on the life-story in
which the germ and seed of such wonderful
fruit ripened is painful. The
descent was not sudden. Verlaine was
one of those wavering characters who
require energetic impulsion for good as
well as for evil. He never slid as on an
inclined plane, but he sank like a scale
weighed down by something unsuspected.
Thus it is possible to name the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>catastrophes and to set the milestones
of his misfortunes.</p>

<p>The great wrench which in 1870
shook his country, also affected his life
and tore it apart. His wedding occurred
during the days of the war.
The fever of political over-excitement
seized him and he, the almost bourgeois
government clerk who never troubled
about politics, became a communist as
a favor to several friends. The anecdote
that he once wished to assassinate
Emperor Napoleon&nbsp;III was a hoax
which he told his comrades for the sake
of the sensation, something like the
story which Baudelaire told of the
&ldquo;savoriness&rdquo; of embryonal brains.</p>

<p>His work consisted in reading the
articles on the Commune which appeared
in the newspapers and marking
them whether they were favorable or
unfavorable. Nevertheless this insignificant
part, which he himself did not
take seriously and spoke of as &ldquo;This
stupid enough rôle which I played during
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>two months of illusions,&rdquo; cost him
his position. This was the break with
well-ordered life and the sign-post
which showed him the way into the
Bohème.</p>

<p>The old wounds re-opened. Verlaine
began to drink again during his
activities in the Commune. Recriminations
and scenes rose as the result of
this relapse. Suddenly came the decisive
act of the drunkard; he struck
his wife the first blow. New misunderstandings
followed, but the household
still held together, soon to be increased
by the arrival of a son.</p>

<p>The final element is still lacking.
Abstractions are weak against realities,
things that have happened may change
men but they cannot vanquish them.
So far everything has been only inchoate
power and a foreshadowing
threat, but not enchantment. It is only
the magic of a passion, an elemental
and unfathomable magnetic power
which links one human being to another,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>the intangible, which can conquer
a poet. He can overcome want and life
because he despises them; he can make
evil powerless because he repents;
chance he can bridge; but he cannot
hold back destiny, nor win battles with
the incomprehensible.</p>

<p>A new influence enters Verlaine's
life&mdash;Arthur Rimbaud.</p>



<div>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
<h2>THE RIMBAUD EPISODE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> matter how much a writer may
have striven for the unusual or have
tried to order confusing ways with intelligence
and form, his fiction does not
reach the depths nor is it as tragic as
this one which life devised. The beginning
is simple, the climax grandiose, of
such wildness and rising to such heights,
that the end no longer could be pure
tragedy. It turned into tragi-comedy,
that grotesque sensation which we feel
when destiny grows beyond human
beings and over-towers them, while
they are still struggling with pigmy
hands to master a monstrous force
which has long gone beyond their control.</p>

<p>The beginning was conventional.
One day Verlaine received a letter from
an acquaintance in the provinces, in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>which poems by a fifteen-year-old boy
were enclosed. Verlaine's opinion was
asked. The poems were: <i>Les Effarés</i>,
<i>Les Assis</i>, <i>Les Poètes de sept ans</i>, <i>Les
Premières communions</i>. Every one
knows they were Arthur Rimbaud's,
for the poems of this boy are among
the most precious of French literature.
He began where the best stop and then,
at twenty, threw literature aside as
something irksome and unimportant.
Verlaine read them and was filled with
enthusiasm. He wrote to the boy in a
tone of glowing admiration. In the
meantime the poems made the rounds
in Paris. Words of characteristically
French emphasis are quickly coined.
Victor Hugo with his regal gesture
declared the author to be &ldquo;<i>Shakespeare
enfant</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The provincial associations of Charleville
filled Rimbaud with disgust and
unrest. Verlaine in his enthusiasm
wrote to him &ldquo;Come, dear great soul,
we are waiting for you, we want you.&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>He himself was without a position and
his own life in Paris at that time was
threatened with chaos and uncertainty,
but with the marvellous folly of yielding
and emotional natures he invited
a stranger as guest into his shaken
destiny.</p>

<p>Rimbaud came. He was a big, robust
fellow filled with a demonic physical
force like that which Balzac has
breathed into his Vautrin types. He
was a provincial with massive red fists
and the curious face of a child that has
been corrupted early in life&mdash;a gamin,
but a genius. Everything in him is
force, over-abundant, wild, exceptional
virility, without aim and turned toward
the infinite.</p>

<p>He is one of the conquistador type,
who first lost his way in literature. He
pours everything into it, fire, fulness,
force, more, much more than great
creators spend. Like a crater he
throws out his mad fever dreams and
visions of life such as perhaps only
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>Dante has had before him. He hurls
everything up into the infinite as if he
would shatter it to bits. Destruction
teems in this creation, a force ardent
for power, a hand that would seize
everything and crush it.</p>

<p>His poems are only sudden gestures
of wrath. They resemble bloody tatters
of raw flesh that have been torn
with wild teeth from the body of reality.
It is poetry &ldquo;outside and above&rdquo;
all literature. Has there ever been a
poet of modern times who thus threw
poems on paper and then let the scraps
flutter to the four winds? Without
pose, unlike Stefan George or Mallarmé,
who calculate carefully, he despised
the public and literature. He
never had a single line printed by his
own efforts, he was utterly regardless
of the fleeting examples of his gigantic
power. At twenty he left his fame and
companions behind to wander through
the world. In Africa he founded fantastic
realms, he sat in prison and there
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>played a part in world history preparing
under King Menelik for the struggle
which cost Italy her provinces. But
in three years he wrote many poems
full of power and fire, including the
eternal poem <i>Le bateau ivre</i>, a staggering
fever dream, into which all the colors,
sounds, forms and forces of life
seem to have been poured, bubbling in
curious forms and seething in the glow
of a feverish moment. His life was
like a dream, as wild, as mighty and as
little subject to time.</p>

<p>Verlaine gladly sheltered the awkward
boy. Madame Verlaine was less
enthusiastic and never concealed her
dislike. Perhaps, with a woman's instinct,
she unconsciously foresaw the
danger which threatened Verlaine in
this new companion.</p>

<p>The bond of friendship grew closer
and closer. Verlaine's <i>gaminerie</i> which
was ever in contrast with his sensitivity,
awakened suddenly. His tendency
toward strong, cynical and lascivious
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>conversation met a genial match in
Rimbaud. The primitive element in
Verlaine was suddenly enchained by
the primæval, purely human and brutal
masculinity of Rimbaud's personality.
The feminine in his nature was feeling
for completion. As if predestined for
each other for years, their personalities
dovetail. Without any affection, by
necessity rather than by friendship,
their union becomes closer and closer.
One day in 1872 Verlaine leaves wife,
child and the world in which he lived to
wander with Rimbaud into the unknown.</p>

<p>Without doubt there was an element
of the abnormal in the relations between
Verlaine and Rimbaud, but to
understand their friendship it is neither
necessary nor essential to know whether
the dangerous potentialities that inhere
in so strong a personal enthusiasm ever
became material facts.</p>

<p>Their path led over the highways
and also through prisons. &ldquo;An evil
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>rage for travelling&rdquo; had seized the two.
Through Belgium, through Germany
and England they wandered; usually
they were without means. They stayed
in London for a while, supporting
themselves by teaching languages and
delving deeper than ever into social
politics. Rimbaud left and returned
just in time to convey the sick Verlaine
home. The terrible life which he had
led had broken him down. He himself
has concealed the tragic incidents of
those days in a novelette, &ldquo;<i>Louise Leclercq</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There he wrote: &ldquo;The few half-crowns
which he earned daily in giving
lessons, they spent in the evening on
Portuguese wine and Irish beer. The
stomach was forgotten, the head became
affected and the lessons were not
given, and thus hunger and nervosity
overcame the reason of this brave fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The patient is taken to Bouillon, a
small town in the Ardennes, where
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>Charles van Lerberghe, the great Belgium
poet, lived, but he has hardly half
recovered when he plunges out into the
world again with Rimbaud. Mental
unrest is transformed into physical unrest.
The lack of stability which operated
most impulsively in that crisis, appears
in his external life. There is
nothing definite for which he is seeking
yet he is unsatisfied. Verlaine, man of
moods <i>par excellence</i>, adjusts himself
to life in his own manner. He becomes
boorish, subject to fits of passion, violent
and unaccountable. His tenderness
seems to have been strangled by
hunger, drunkenness and wild destiny.
The friendship for Rimbaud also assumes
evil shapes. More and more frequently
they quarrel; almost every
hour Rimbaud's foaming temperament
and Verlaine's temporary hard, wild
manner come in conflict. Of course, as
a rule, they were drunk. Rimbaud, who
was strong, drank because of his feeling
of strength and because he yearned for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>the intoxication in which colors glowed,
in which impulses became wilder, and
association more rapid, acute and
bolder. Verlaine fled to absinthe to
drown out repentance, anguish and
weakness; and from this sweetish drink,
in which all the evil forces of life seem
to be distilled, he drew brutality and
feverish disorders.</p>

<p>Once Verlaine ran away, but became
repentant and asked Rimbaud to join
him. Rimbaud followed him to Belgium.
All difficulties were about to be
solved. Madame Verlaine was ready
to forgive and was on her way to meet
the penitent. Then Rimbaud too declared
that he would leave him. No
one knows how it happened, whether it
was jealousy, anger, hatred, love or
only drunkenness, at any rate the disaster
followed on the public street of
Brussels. Verlaine pursued Rimbaud
and shot at him twice with a revolver,
wounding him once. The police came,
and though Rimbaud defended and excused
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>Verlaine, the latter was arrested.
The sentence was two years in prison,
and these Verlaine spent at Mons.
The immediate result was a divorce,
upon which Madame Verlaine insisted
with every possible emphasis and in
spite of Victor Hugo's intervention.</p>

<p>This conclusion, however, was too
banal and trite for so heroic a tragedy.
The friendship persisted. Verlaine and
Rimbaud corresponded. Verlaine sent
occasional poems from prison and told
Rimbaud of his conversion. The latter
hardly pleased Rimbaud, who was at
that time cold and indifferent toward
everything except that he was filled
with a thirst for something unique and
infinite and looking forward to new adventures.
Verlaine had hardly been released
before he tried to convert Rimbaud
to this religious life in order to
link their lives anew. &ldquo;Let us love
each other in Jesus Christ,&rdquo; he wrote in
his proselyting ardor and with the enthusiasm
which in the beginning he always
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>felt for everything. Rimbaud
smiled mockingly and finally declared
that &ldquo;Loyola&rdquo; should visit him in
Stuttgart.</p>

<p>Now the moment arrived when
comedy outdid the tragedy of the reunion.
Verlaine arrived at Stuttgart
and attempted the conversion&mdash;unfortunately
in an inn, a place little adapted
for proselytes and prophets, for both
the saint and the mocker still had in
common their passion for drink. No
one witnessed the scene; only the result
is known. On the way home both were
drunk, and a quarrel ensued and a
unique incident in the history of literature
followed.</p>

<p>In the flooding moonlight by the
banks of the Neckar the two greatest
living poets in France fell upon each
other in wild rage with sticks and fists.
The struggle did not last long. Rimbaud,
athletic, like a wild animal, a man
of passion, easily subdued the nervous,
weakly Verlaine, stumbling in drunkenness.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>A blow over the head knocked
him down. Bleeding and unconscious,
he remained lying on the bank.</p>

<p>It was the last time they saw each
other. Verlaine disappeared on the
next day. The episode had come to an
end, but nevertheless several letters
passed back and forth. Then Rimbaud's
grandiose Odyssey through the
entire world began. For many years
his friends in Paris believed him dead,
and even to-day relatively little is
known of his life afterward.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In Vienna he was under arrest as a
vagrant, in the Balkans he was a merchant.
Then fulfilling his early prophecy
in the <i>Bateau ivre</i> he said farewell
to Europe and in Africa became discoverer,
general, conqueror. In these
unexpected fields he spent to the last
limits his titanic energy, which in
youthful crises had been expended on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>the fragile and for him too weakly material
of language and rhyme. Until
the day of his death, he, <i>the only true
despiser of literature of these days</i>,
never wrote another line, and endeavored
only to give form to his wild and
fantastic dreams in the material of life,
dying in fever as feverishly he lived.</p>

<p>For Verlaine it was an episode&mdash;the
most important, it is true, in a life
which was torn to many tatters. After
his conversion, which will be discussed
more fully later, he returned to Paris
and literature, and died in harness,
physically in 1896, as artist much
earlier.</p>

<h2>THE PENITENT</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known that at the moment
when he left the prison at Mons, Paul
Verlaine, the prisoner, entered the
ranks of the great Catholic poets. A
complete transformation took place in
his life. He turned from the material
to the spiritual. The penitent mood of
his childhood days glimmered again
when he thought of the Nazarene. The
soft early yearnings which were forgotten
in his years of wandering became
symbolized into a definite idea. Nor is
this surprising in one who never could
understand his intellectual processes,
but who was moved entirely by the ebb
and flow of emotion, and who always
wavered unsteadily in all the crises of
life.</p>

<p>In general it is almost a necessity
among poets that poetic feeling should
be transmuted into religious feeling.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>But the creative poets of active mentality
and intellectuality build their own
religion, while the sensitive or passive
poets pour out their flood of feeling
for God in the form of existing rites
and symbols. Balzac clearly shows this
relationship when he says in <i>The Thirteen</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are not religion, love and poetry,
the threefold expression of the same
fact, the need for expression which fills
every noble soul? These three creative
impulses rise up toward God, who concentrates
in himself all earthly emotions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Religion is only a certain form of
association in which things are placed
in relationship with each other. Similarly
the sensation of evening, of the
cool pure air after rain, of the whispering
of the winds and the play of clouds,
or whatever else is caught up in the
nervous fever of poetic sensibility,
hearkens back to the infinite after it
has been permeated by the poet's own
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>sorrow or joy. He feels that the infinite
has a soul which understands and
atones for all sorrows, and thus he conceives
it as divinity. The poet's religion
is derived from the one great faith
with which he must be filled, which is
the necessity for being understood. It
is only one step further when he finds
that his soul's outflow must lead somewhere,
and then he gives a name, a form
and an interpretation to what has been
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>But a more definite element in Paul
Verlaine drove him into the arms of
Catholicism. It was his <i>impulse to confession</i>,
which I have tried to show was
the most intensive element in his personality.
A soul which lacks ethical
authority for self-control, in its helplessness
must turn with accusation and
pleading toward others, toward something
outside of the self.</p>

<p>Cry and sigh are the original forms
of all lyricism, and just as they are a
sweet compulsion to expel an inner
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>overflow by utterance, so confession is
only deliverance from an inner pressure,
from guilt and penitence, from
mighty forces, accordingly, which the
confessor wishes to transmit to others.
It is a need for explanation, a marvellous
deception, a means to tame forces
by trust, a trust which is not felt toward
one's self. Goethe's much-quoted
words of the fragments of the &ldquo;great
confession&rdquo; are still to the point, no
matter how often they have been used.
As he wrote to rid his mind of incidents
which he had experienced, so Verlaine
told of himself, now to the public, now
to the confessor. The fundamental
process, however, is identical.</p>

<p>Many other things coöperated.
There was the great antithesis between
flesh and spirit, between body and soul;
contempt for the sensual and continual
fall into sin&mdash;the immanent conflict of
childish and animal feeling which
flooded forever wildly through Verlaine's
years of manhood. This also has
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>been for centuries the symbol of the
Catholic Church. In it sensitive and
mystical emotion found a dogmatic
form, through the fundamental principle
of the antithesis between the earthly
and the transcendental. In the same
way the consciousness of the value of
the sensual as sin and of the pure as
virtue is only a reflex of the subjective
impressions of pure souls. Here Verlaine
found a definite form for the
warning which flickered unsteadily in
him. By confession he was able to place
his sins into the dreamy hands of the
immaculate Virgin; in her form he was
at last able worthily to give substance
to the dream-like shadows of the soft
unsensual women, which glimmered
like stars over his life. It was the need
for quiet after storms, confession after
sins.</p>

<p>Childhood bells called him back to
the church. Pale ancient memories led
him&mdash;the pomp of the solemn great
processions which he saw in Montpellier.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>The <i>bon enfant</i> awoke in him
again. The memory of his own folded
hands, of his timid child's voice lisping
prayers, and of his sacred soft baptismal
name, <i>Marie</i>, rose in him. The dark
mysticism and the wonderful blue half-lights
of Catholic faith called the
dreamer. The same incense shadow of
vague violent emotion led the romantic
dreamers, Stolberg, Schlegel and Novalis,
from the cool, clear and transparent
air of Protestantism into a foreign
faith. The <i>leitmotiv</i> of Verlaine's
poetry was his yearning and the infinitely
beautiful and persistent impulse of
the unhappy toward childhood and the
magic of a primitively reverent life
close to God. These wrought the miracle.</p>

<p>If trust were to be put in the corrupt
man of letters who wrote the <i>Confessions</i>,
it was a true miracle, like that in
the cell of Saint Anthony, which
brought him into the arms of the
Church.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
In his narrow room, in which he read
Shakespeare and other worldly books,
hung a simple crucifix, unnoticed at
first. Of it he wrote:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not what or Who suddenly
raised me in the night, threw me from
my bed without even leaving me time
to dress, and prostrated me weeping
and sobbing at the feet of the crucifix
and before the supererogatory image of
the Catholic Church, which has evoked
the most strange, but in my eyes the
most sublime devotion of modern
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the following day he asked for
a priest and confessed his sins. At
that hour, Verlaine, the Catholic poet,
was born. He was wonderfully primitive,
like the early poets of the Church,
and his verses were as full of profound
mystic poetry as those of the saints,
Augustine and Francis of Assisi, and
those of the German philosopher poets,
Eckart and Tauler.</p>

<p>During these two years the neophyte
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>wrote <i>Sagesse</i>, a volume which appeared
later under the imprint of an
exclusively Catholic publisher. It is
the deepest and greatest work of
French poetry, &ldquo;the white crown of his
work,&rdquo; Verhaeren calls it in his brilliant
study of Verlaine. Here again, as
once in the <i>Bonne Chanson</i>, the divergent
forms of his character unite. In
the unrestrained solution of everything
personal in the divine, in &ldquo;the melting
of his own heart in the glowing heart
of God,&rdquo; impulse and yearning are
purified. Eroticism becomes spiritualized
into fervor; hope, into sublime
enlightenment; passion, devouring
earthly dross, takes the form of mystic
surrender. Thus the impulsive in Verlaine,
permeated by hours of pure emotion,
obtains its wild power of beauty,
and trembles in the inexplicable mystery
and in the stream of visionary
light, so that his entire life now seems
illumined.</p>

<p>In his religion likewise it is the purely
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>human element which is so wonderful.
Verlaine does not possess the seraphic
mildness of Novalis, nor the consumptive,
girl-like, sickly-beautiful inclination
of the pre-Raphaelites toward the
miraculous image. He is passionate
and vehement. He is masculine where
the others become feminine. Like a
timid girl, Novalis dreams of Jesus as
his bride. &ldquo;If I have Him only, if He
only is mine,&rdquo; he says and his words
become a chaste love song.</p>

<p>Verlaine, however, is a reverberating
echo of the great seekers after God, of
the church fathers, of St. Augustine
and of the mystics, and he wrestles for
an almost physical love of God. His
passion is often impious in its earthiness;
his yearning, sacrilege.</p>

<p>In his sonnet cycle, <i>Mon dieu m'a dit</i>,
is a place where the soul, wounded by
the lighting of divine love, cries out, unconscious
whether in joy or pain:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;">
<div class="stanza">
&ldquo;Quoi, moi, moi pouvoir Vous aimer.<br/>
<span class="i3"><ins title="Etez vous">Êtes-vous</ins> fous?&rdquo;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
In these impious words God is humanized
vividly, and yet, by the very
bitterness of the struggle with His all-goodness,
the poet imbues Him with an
absolute perfection.</p>

<p>Here Verlaine's tormented soul is
entirely cast out of himself, and
plunges in a sudden flood into the infinite.
Ecstasy overcomes the feminine
element in him, just as in his life vulgar
drunkenness roused his hard,
coarse and brutal qualities. For a
moment Verlaine is not only a genuine
and marvellous, but also a truly strong
and creative poet; no longer elegiac
and sensitive, but creative.</p>

<p>In the reflux of enthusiasm come
silent tender hours with songs in which
the notes are muffled. They are the
poems he wrote in the prison which
gave him quietude and shelter, and in
the silence of which the soft voices of
his childhood rose again. Each one of
these poems is noble, simple, and chaste.
It is only necessary to name the titles to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>hear the soft violin note of their mild
sadness&mdash;&ldquo;Un grand sommeil noir,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Le ciel, est, par dessus le toit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Je
ne sais pas pourquoi mon esprit amer,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Le son du cor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Je ne veux plus
aimer que ma mère Marie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is truly &ldquo;<i>le <ins title="coeur">c&oelig;ur</ins> plus veuf que
<ins title="tout">toutes</ins> les veuves</i>&rdquo; that speaks in them.</p>

<p>When the &ldquo;<i>guote suendaere</i>&rdquo; again
went out into life which he had never
been able to master, and the wild restlessness
and torment began which tore
his heart into tatters, nothing remained
of the two years in prison except his
pious faith and a sorrowful memory.
The four walls which had enclosed him
also had protected him. &ldquo;He was truly
himself only in the hospital and in
prison,&rdquo; says Huysmans.</p>

<p>Poor Lelian's longing plaint is for
this silence. &ldquo;Ah truly, I regret the
two years in the tower.&rdquo; His song
says &ldquo;Formerly I dwelt in the best of
castles.&rdquo; His yearning for the elemental,
&ldquo;far from a curbed age,&rdquo; never left
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>him since those hours, and least of all
in Paris, the city of his crowning fame
as a poet. Faith he soon lost, but never
the yearning for faith.</p>

<p>In addition Verlaine wrote a long
series of Catholic poems. As will be
shown later, he outraged his unique
qualities and thus destroyed them. The
unconscious portion, the wonderful
fragrance of his early religious poems,
which were entirely emotional, soon dissipated.
He constructed an infinite
number of pious verses, verses for
saints' days, religious emblems, and
compiled volumes of poetry for Catholic
publishers. At the same time he
edited pornographica and all manner
of indecencies. His conversion had
created a sensation. He had been
thrust into a rôle and felt it his duty
to play the part and to retain the costume.
This was the reason for the antithesis.
I do not believe the faith of
his later years to have been genuine.
He has called himself &ldquo;the ruin of a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>still Christian philosopher already
pagan,&rdquo; and in his obscene books turned
the rites of Catholic faith, which he
elsewhere glorified, into phallic and
other sexual symbols.</p>

<p>He was unable to escape the realization
of the comedy of this situation.
In his autobiography, <i>Hommes d'aujourd'hui</i>,
he attempted a very ingenious
but exceedingly unsatisfactory
justification. &ldquo;His work,&rdquo; he explains,
speaking of poor Lelian, &ldquo;from 1880
took on two very sharply defined directions,
and the prospectuses of his future
books indicated that he had made up
his mind to continue this system and to
publish, if not simultaneously, at least
in parallel, works absolutely different
in idea&mdash;to be more exact, books in
which Catholicism unfolds its logic and
its lures, its blandishments and its terrors;
and others purely modern, sensual
with a distressing good humor and
full of the pride of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Can this be the program of the &ldquo;unconscious?&rdquo;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>A few lines further on he
has given another explanation. &ldquo;I believe,
and I am a good Christian at this
moment; I believe, and I am a bad
Christian the instant after. The remembrance
of hope, the evocation of a
sin, delight me with or without remorse.&rdquo;
This is the truth. Verlaine
was a man of moods, he was always
only the creature of the moment.
After a few seconds the movement of
his will contracted limply and momentary
desires overflooded his consciousness
of personality. His faith may
have been as capricious and restless, as
each one of his tendencies of passion.
Great poems, however, in the sense of
great in extent, are not conceived in a
moment. Moods spread like a fine mist
over the poet's hours, they permeate
them and fill them through and through
for a long time before a poem takes
form.</p>

<p>Verlaine, the man of letters and poet
according to program, is a hateful
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>shadow limping behind his great works.
Consciously and with feverish eagerness
and a productivity forced by need,
he rhymed in what he thought his
unique manner. The poor old man
whom interviewers sought in the hospital
was no longer the poet, Paul Verlaine.</p>

<p>It is impossible to tell how long the
flame of personal faith still glowed in
him. Probably it was as little extinguished
as his soft dream of childhood.
In the dusk of his last years it often
struggled upward with tears, as a symbol
of sorrow over his broken life.</p>

<p>As all his thought began to tend
toward senile mistiness, his emotions
also slowly deteriorated in indifference
and drunkenness. It was not his companions
in his cups who understood him
best, but the poets who saw his life in
the illuminating perspective of distance.</p>

<p>In a short story, <i>Gestas</i>, Anatole
France has marvellously described in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>his insistent, quiet, dignified fashion the
mingling of purity and depravity in
this life of curious piety. It is merely
an anecdote. Stumbling, a drunkard
enters church in the early morn to confess
his sins. The priest has not yet
arrived. The drunkard begins to grow
noisy, beats the prayer desks; he rages
and weeps, he has so endlessly many
sins to confess, he wants only a little
priest, a very, very little one.</p>

<p>In these few pages everything is
compressed, &ldquo;the prodigal child with
the gestures of a satyr.&rdquo; All the traits
of Verlaine are here, the accusing one
of the penitent which he never lost, the
angry one of the drunkard, the yearning
tenderness of the poet, all the childishly
wise, and yet in its simplicity so
marvellously wonderful, faith of the
good sinner.</p>



<div>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
<h2>LEGENDS AND LITERATURE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> hesitates to relate the last years
of this curious life. From the moment
that Verlaine returned to Paris the
tragedy lacks æsthetic significance.
There are no longer sudden descents
and elevations, but his life is slowly
stifled in <i>camaraderie</i>, lingering disease
and depravity. His poetic force crumbles
away, his uniqueness becomes extinguished.
It is no longer a foaming
wave crest that carries him away, but
dirty little waves.</p>

<p>When he came to Paris, he had been
forgotten. His books were lying unsold
with the publishers; the majority
of his friends avoided him, evidently
because their frock coat of the Academy
made recognition difficult, until suddenly
the younger generation began to
noise about his name; and now more
people quarrel over starting this movement
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>than there were cities to claim
Homer's cradle.</p>

<p>It was a period of development.
French lyric poetry was passing
through a revolutionary crisis. For the
first time the marble image of &ldquo;<i>beauté
impassible</i>&rdquo; trembled in the hands of
the poets. But not one of them was a
strong enough artist to create a new
ideal. At this moment the younger
men began to remember Verlaine. His
Bohemian life, the soft, fluctuating
dreamy manner of his art, the frenzy of
his life, his recklessness, loyalty and elementalness
were a marvellous antithesis
to the well-bred &ldquo;<i>impassibilité</i>&rdquo; of
the Academy. His name was used as
a battering-ram against the Parnassians.
In kindly fashion, without
choice, Verlaine, the old man, who was
beginning to feel chill, accepted the late
enthusiasm and veneration.</p>

<p>Literature alone is not yet sufficient
to create fame in France. It was only
when the great journals began to take
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>an interest in his life that he became
popular. And at that time a mass of
paltry legends began to gather around
his name. He became the &ldquo;naive child
of modern culture,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Bohemian,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Unconscious,&rdquo; the &ldquo;New François
Villon,&rdquo; and even to-day these
stereotyped phrases are industriously
repeated.</p>

<p>Indeed his life was strange. In hospitals
the poet sought shelter. With
a white cloth wound like a turban
around his bald, Socrates-like head, he
was always surrounded by contemporary
literature, which strove to rise with
the aid of his name. He received interviewers,
and wrote his poems on prescription
blanks and smeary tatters.
When he was well, he wandered from
café to café, holding forth and gesticulating,
getting drunk, and associating
with lewd women, always with a certain
ostentation whenever he noticed that
the public was watching him. As a
senile Silenus, he presided over the most
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>remarkable bacchanalia. Like a second
Victor Hugo, he patronized the
younger men with benevolent gesture.
A forced merriness seemed in those
days to tremble electrically through his
nerves. Yet never before had his life
been filled with deeper tragedy and
yearning, and there were many hours
when he himself felt this keenly.
Crushed and torn by the teeth of life,
he, like all Bohemians, at last desired
only peace. Never was the sweet
dream of his childhood days more
poignant than in just this period of dissolute
play-acting and vain exhibitionism.</p>

<p>Taine has very accurately shown that
creative art consists in the automatization
of the creative individuality, in
overhearing and imitating inherent
qualities, and in objectifying the personal
elements. This process too became
operative in Verlaine's life, more
markedly because in him life and personality
were immanent interaction.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
He caricatured himself and re-drew
the delicate lines of his soul with crude
pencil. Consciously he tried to make
the unconscious elements take plastic
form again by way of reflection. He
was no longer elemental, but he strove
hard to be. He prayed to God &ldquo;to
give me all simplicity,&rdquo; because he
knew it was expected of him. Since he
was counted among the Catholic poets,
he tried again to pass through the
storm of sacred emotion. The effort
resulted in pompous, well-constructed
religious poems, plump like botched
Roman churches.</p>

<p>He attempted to show the unconscious
in himself by striving to explain
the creative impulse and placing mirrors
behind his juggler's tricks. The
wonderful gesture of surrender which
destiny and sorrow had taught him, he
learned by heart like an actor who reproduces
a gesture mechanically at
the seventy succeeding performances,
though he is truly an artist only at the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>moment when he first discovers and understands
its significance in studying
the part. Thus Verlaine carefully reconstructed
all the characteristics which
the journals declared were his own.
Coquettishly he exhibited the &ldquo;poor
Lelian&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<i>bon enfant</i>&rdquo;&mdash;mere
costumes of a poetical fire that
had long died out. His manner became
more and more childlike; he was trying
to enter entirely into the rôle of
&ldquo;<i>guileless fool</i>,&rdquo; while his sharp but
unlogical intelligence never gave way.</p>

<p>The poet retired further and further
into him. The more he rhymed (and in
the last years with morbid frequency),
the fewer poems were produced. Now
and then one came, when pose and impulse
joined in minutes of sad (or
drunken) melancholy, and when the
mysterious fluid of the unconscious and
great indefinite emotions made him
silent, simple and timid.</p>

<p>Otherwise he alternately turned
erotic incidents and adventures in alcoves
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>into rhyme, and wrote literary
mockeries and parodies of Paul Verlaine,
and for purposes of contrast,
verses in praise of Catholic saint days.
Every artistic pride was soon forgotten
in the need for money. He sold his
poems at one hundred sous apiece to his
publisher Vanier, who cruelly printed
them often against the active protest
of the poet; recently again a volume of
&ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; which easily
may be denominated as one of the most
disagreeable and worst books published
in France. This portion of the
tragedy of his life no one has as yet
fully told.</p>

<p>During his last years he wrote two
books which must not be ignored even
though they do not fit in the customary
picture of the <i>bon enfant</i>. These were
<i>Femmes</i> and <i>Hombres</i>. They could
not appear publicly but were sold in
five hundred numbered copies each. In
them Verlaine broke abruptly with the
tradition of agreeable nastiness of a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>Grecourt, in order to produce works of
an unheard-of subjective shamelessness.
In form the poems are smooth and in
structure they are clever, but their subject
matter and the poet's self-revelation
is such as to place these volumes
among the most unhappy that have
ever been produced. They are naked
and obscene.</p>

<p>From an æsthetic point of view this
publication, even if it was clandestine
was without excuse, and it was the deepest
descent of the poet. The effect of
this depravity of an old man writing
down with unsteady hand vices and
nakednesses on prescription blanks for
the sake of a few francs with which to
buy an absinthe, is tragic. The existence
and the spread of these books
must destroy absolutely the legend of
the &ldquo;guileless fool.&rdquo; This is the only
value which can be attributed to them.</p>

<p>The carnival comedy took place before
Ash Wednesday. When Leconte
de Lisle died, the younger generation
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>advertised and arranged for the choice
of the king of poets, never realizing to
what extent they were guilty in bringing
about the artistic degeneration of
the chosen poet. The faun-like, mockingly
sagacious head of Paul Verlaine,
who was ill and growing old, received
the crown. Poor Lelian became &ldquo;king
of the poets,&rdquo; a mark of great affection
on the part of the younger men, but
only a title after all, which was unable
to give Paul Verlaine the necessary
dignity and strength of personality.
After Verlaine, Stéphane Mallarmé inherited
the imaginary crown, and after
him it was worn in obscurity by Leon
Dierx,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a not very distinguished, but
agreeable and dignified poet of the
former Parnassus. The coronation was
only a pose and voluntary choice, and
would hardly be worth considering were
it not for the fact that this admiration
for Verlaine's work indicated an underlying
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>tendency in modern French poetry.</p>

<p>To the younger generation Verlaine
represented not only a great poet, but
to them he was also the regenerator of
French lyric poetry. The legend that
Verlaine consciously changed poetic
valuations is entirely due to a single
poem, the &ldquo;<i>Art Poétique</i>.&rdquo; It is absolutely
necessary to quote it, because on
the one hand it is characteristic of
Verlaine's instinct concerning his own
work, and because on the other hand it
is the basis of all the formulas which
became dogmas among the verse jugglers.

<p>Without question certain words in
these lines, somewhat veiled by the
poetic form of expression, harmonize
with the fundamental conceptions of
modern impressionistic lyric poetry.
France never was the land of pure
emotional poetry. There is too much
sense of the formal, too much of a keen-sighted
almost mathematical type of
intellect mingled with a gallant pleasure
in pointedness among the French,
and these make them turn into logic
the elements of mysticism which must
be in every poem, whether in its emotional
content or its vague form of expression.
Goethe has proclaimed the
incommensurable as the material of all
poetry, but among the French the tendency
to crystallize it in the solution of
their positivist habit of thought is ever
imperceptibly betrayed. The feeling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>for the line and style shows through.
For them poetry is architecture; intuition,
their intellectual formula; the
marble of conceptions is their material,
and rhyme the mortar.</p>

<p>Clarity and orderly arrangement are
the preliminary conditions for Victor
Hugo, for the Parnassians and even
for Baudelaire, even though the latter,
by his visionary form and the opiate of
his dark words, created for the first time
solemn, that is to say poetical, impressions
instead of those of pomp alone.
It seems therefore an error to look for
the revolutionary tendency and literary
importance of a Verlaine in the looseness
of his verse structure and more
careless (or intentionally careless) use
of rhyme. His merit is rather that he
was able to illume chaos, darkness, and
presentiments by the very indefiniteness
and the vague music of his soul.
This enabled him to endue his poems
with their mystical trembling melody,
not by abstracting his inner music in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>definite melodies, but by fixing it in
assonance, rhymes and rhythmic waves.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he recognized that
lyric art is the most immaterial of all
and is most nearly related to music.
Its aërial trembling and immateriality
may meet the soul in waves of glowing
fire, but intellectually it is unseizable.
He tried to preserve this musical element
by means of harmony and assonance,
but it was not he himself so
much as the unconscious gift of poetry
that played mysteriously in him and
made him find the fundamental secret
of lyric effects. Émile Verhaeren, the
only other French poet who is a more
vehement and constructive character,
sought and found the musical element
of lyric poetry by the only other way,
that is, in verbal rhythm or consonantal
music. Thus to volatilize the material
simultaneously in the form and to join
the technical with the intuitive elements
is the highest quality of lyric poetry.
It makes it immediate, organic, that is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>to say, its spiritual elements permeate
the material in immanent reaction, and
thus the mystery of life is renewed in
individual artifacts. Self-evidently this
intuitive recognition is no discovery.
It has been present in the great lyric
poets of all time, a mystery like that
of sexual reproduction, which awakens
only at the age of ripeness. It was new
in France only because, besides Villon,
Verlaine was the first lyric genius of
the French.</p>

<p>The mystery of the German folk-song
with its simple, sweetly mysterious
essence became realized in him, perhaps
because there was an undercurrent of
national relationship. Because of the
weakness, submissiveness and child-like
confusion of his emotionality, the vibrations
became tonality, sound and, because
he was a poet, music, instead of
intellectual structures.</p>

<p>Such art must be more effective as
contrasted with all intellectualism because
it springs from deeper sources,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>just as simple weeping is more eloquent
than passionate wailing aloud.
Surely it also contains an artificial element,
not artistry, but magic art, or the
&ldquo;alchemy of the word&rdquo; which Rimbaud
<ins title="believed, to">believed to</ins> have discovered, a relationship
between colors, vowels and
sounds depending on <ins title="idiosyncracy">idiosyncrasy</ins>. It
is a secret touching of the ultimate
roots of different stems. It is always
necessary to assume an inter-relation
between lyricism and the lawless, enigmatic
and magic elements of the human
soul and to associate vague threshold
emotions with soft music.</p>

<p>Verlaine's poetry during his creative
period possesses this vagueness, which
is like a voice in the dark or music of
the soul. It also has the lack of coherence
which emotions must have when
they sweep in halting pain through the
body. This element must remain incomprehensible
to commercially sharp
intelligences of the type of Max Nordau,
who try in a way to subtract the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>net value of purely intellectual elements
and &ldquo;contents&rdquo; which could be
reduced to prose from the gross value
of poems. Lyricism is magic and the
precious possession of a spiritual communion
which finds its deepest enjoyment
in just these almost impalpable
elements.</p>

<p>To limit the most important element
of Verlaine's significance to his neglect
of rhyme is showing poor judgment.
In the first place it is unimportant and
secondly incorrect, for he never wrote
a poem without rhyme, except in the
later unworthy years, when now and
then he substituted assonances. In addition
he has himself protested in
<i>L'Hommes d'Aujourd'hui</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the past and at present too I
am honored by having my name mingled
with these disputes, and I pass for
a bitter adversary of rhyme because of
a selection published in a recent collection.&mdash;Besides
absolute liberty is my
device if it were necessary for me to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>have one&mdash;and I find good everything
which is good in despite and notwithstanding
rules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To many it was insufficient to celebrate
Verlaine as one of the marvels of
a nation, a truly elemental human being
whose soul uttered the finest and
most tender lyric moods and who, as if
awakened out of bell-like and clear
dreams, produced true and melodic
poetry out of the darkness of his life.
His admirers have also praised him as
a prose writer. But the prose-writer
must be an intellectual creator, and
know how to master form. This Verlaine
was unable to do. He never
really understood the world, and knew
only how to tell of himself, and accordingly
his novelettes are for the most
part concealed autobiographies. They
have brilliant portions of characterization.
His intellect, which is paradoxical,
self-willed, lyrical, and abrupt,
flashes up and then crumbles.</p>

<p>His <i>Confessions</i>, which have been
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>highly praised, remind one of Rousseau's
all too confidential and hypocritical
confessions. They are only
documents of personal sharp-sightedness,
unfortunately much over-clouded
by literary pose. He also tried the
theatre. His comedy, <i>Les Uns et les
Autres</i>, has Watteau-like style and
Pierrot elegances, as well as flexibility,
but is of no importance. Another play,
<i>Louis&nbsp;XVI</i>, remained a fragment. All
Verlaine's literary productions, like
biographies, introductions, etc., give
a painful impression because they are
forced and have sprung from evil
<i>camaraderie</i>.</p>

<p>He has also been called a great
draftsman. It is true that an excellent
and characteristic skill in the figures
and scribblings which he sprinkled
throughout his letters cannot be gainsaid.
There is even a pathetic element
in their self-confessed technical imperfections.
The caricatures are playful,
without malicious or serious intent,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>jotted down with childish self-satisfaction,
but, of course, they need not be
taken seriously. They are little marginalia
to his life, and addenda to the
numerous sharp and bright sketches
with which his intimate friend and artistic
Eckermann, F.&nbsp;A. Cazals, has
fixed him for posterity. They show
Verlaine in all his moods&mdash;in his bonhomie,
despair, grief, &ldquo;<i>gaminerie</i>,&rdquo; sexuality,
disease, even to the last sketches
which show him in death. They form
a gallery of his life from childhood to
childhood along the dark way of his
destiny. And as in his poetry, notwithstanding
all the exuberant passages,
the final impression is a wailing
note of sadness&mdash;the stroke of melancholy's
bow.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
<h2>POSTLUDE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> only thing which now remains is
to ascertain whether Paul Verlaine's
life-work, beginning in Metz and ending
in a small lodging-house room in
Paris on a January day in 1896, contains
the elements which we would call
&ldquo;lasting&rdquo; because we are afraid of the
proud and resounding word &ldquo;eternal.&rdquo;
The significance of great poets passes
the boundaries of literature and ignores
what is known as &ldquo;influences&rdquo; and
&ldquo;artistic atmosphere.&rdquo; The eternal
element of great works of poetry
reaches back toward eternity. For
humanity poetry is infinity which it
joins with the ether, and the great poets
are those who were able to help in
elaborating the wonderful bond which
stretches from the distant darkness to
the red of the new dawn.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
It does not diminish Verlaine's stature
if we do not count him among the
heroes of life. He was an isolated phenomena,
too significant to be typical
and too weak to become eternal. There
was beauty in his pure humanness, but
not of the kind which remains permanent.
He has given nothing which was
not already in us. He was a fleeting
stream of life passing by; he was the
sublime echo of the mysterious music
which rises within us on every contact
of things, like the ring of glasses on a
cupboard under every footstep and impact.</p>

<p>His effect is deep, but yet on that
account not great. To have become
great it would have been necessary for
him to conquer the destiny which he
could not master and to liberate his will
from the thousand little vices and passions
which enwrapped it. He is one of
the writers who could be spared, whom
nevertheless no one would do without.
He is a marvel, beautiful and unnecessary,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>like a rare flower which gives
sweetness and wonderful peace to the
senses, but which does not make us
noble, strong, brave and humble.</p>

<p>He was, and herein lies his greatness
and power, the symbol of pure humanity,
splendid creative force in the weak
vessel of his personality. He was a
poet who in his works became one with
the poetry of life, the sounds of the
forest, the kiss of the wind, the rustling
of the reeds and the voice of the dusk
of evening. Humanly he was like us
who love him. He was one of those
who, no matter how great a chaos they
have made of their own life, are yet
inappeasable, and drink the stranger's
pain and the stranger's bliss in the precious
cup of glorious poetry. They
manifold their being and their emotions
because of a blind and uncreative yearning
for the universal and infinity.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
